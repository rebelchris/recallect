## Product Direction
Recallect should feel like a personal relationship coach, not a contact database:
- Tell me who matters today.
- Tell me why.
- Let me act in one tap.

## UX Principles
- One-screen clarity: top actions first, details second.
- Explainable intelligence: every suggestion shows the reason.
- Low-friction capture: logging interactions should take under 30 seconds.
- Calm interface: clean hierarchy, clear priority labels, minimal visual noise.

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Actionable Intelligence MVP
Goals:
- Turn existing data into ranked daily priorities.
- Make follow-through faster from the dashboard.

Deliverables:
1. `Today Focus` queue on home dashboard.
2. Priority scoring from:
   - pending reminders,
   - upcoming important dates,
   - contact staleness vs frequency.
3. One-tap actions per suggestion:
   - open contact,
   - log interaction.
4. Reason labels (for trust): e.g. `Reminder due today`, `Birthday tomorrow`.

Success metrics:
- Increase in weekly logged interactions.
- Faster time-to-first-action from home screen.

## Phase 2 (Weeks 3-5): Better Prep + Better Follow-up
Goals:
- Reduce thinking overhead before and after meetings.

Deliverables:
1. Contact brief card:
   - last interaction summary,
   - open reminders,
   - upcoming dates.
2. Post-interaction assistant:
   - quick follow-up template suggestions,
   - optional reminder preset in one tap.
3. “Open loops” view:
   - unresolved reminders and stale promises.

Success metrics:
- More reminders completed.
- Lower overdue reminder count.

## Phase 3 (Weeks 6-8): Relationship Health Layer
Goals:
- Surface risk early and guide consistent relationship maintenance.

Deliverables:
1. Relationship health score per contact:
   - freshness,
   - consistency,
   - follow-through.
2. Segment-aware queues:
   - Family/Friends/Work each get tailored defaults.
3. Weekly review screen:
   - who was ignored,
   - who got attention,
   - suggested next steps.

Success metrics:
- Reduced “overdue” contacts.
- Higher consistency for high-priority contacts.

## Keep It Simple Checklist (for every feature)
- No new setup required.
- Works with existing contact/conversation/reminder data.
- Adds one clear user action, not just information.
- Mobile-first layout and tap targets.
